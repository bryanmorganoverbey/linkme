Amplify CLI will use DynamoDB for data storage
some good documentation to get started understanding dynambodb with our graphql api
<https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/data-modeling/>

The Schema for our DB is stored in the linkme/amplify/backend/api/linkme/schema.graphql file.
When you update the schema and run 'amplify api push', the changes are reflected in the DB
